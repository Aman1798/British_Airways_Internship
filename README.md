# British_Airways_Internship
 This GitHub repository contains my British Airways task materials, which I completed during the Data Science course offered by British Airways on Forage. Throughout the program, I undertook various tasks to deepen my understanding of data science and its applications in the airline industry. Firstly, I conducted a simulation to demonstrate the critical role of data science in contributing to the success of British Airways. Secondly, I employed web scraping techniques to gather and analyze customer review data, uncovering valuable insights that could inform business decisions. Lastly, I developed a predictive model using random forest methodology to identify the factors influencing consumer purchasing behavior, providing a framework for optimizing marketing strategies and enhancing customer satisfaction.
